Poop Journal is a medical Flutter app to monitor your poo. A good poop is essential to a healthy and fit body. This app makes it possible to track:

- when you poop (timestamp)
- how often you poop
- how it was like (pain level)
- how it looked like (take a picture), colour scheme
- food that could cause the problem in the toilet
- sporting activity
- medication

The aim of this app is to make or keep you healthy and fit. I appreciate support and feedback. Drop an email to marvin@poopjournal.rocks.
